# Blockchain Simulation Platform

[中文版README](README_zh.md)

---

## Project Overview

I am a graduate student, and this is a blockchain simulation platform built for the experiments in my thesis. The platform is designed to provide a modular and extensible environment for blockchain research and development. It currently supports the following transaction models:

- **UTXO Model**
- **Account Model**
- **Custom Smart Contract Transactions**

The platform's modular design allows easy swapping and integration of various consensus protocols, making it flexible for blockchain experiments and testing.

## Key Features

- **Support for Multiple Transaction Models**: Includes UTXO, Account, and custom smart contract transactions.
- **Modular Design**: Consensus protocols and transaction processing modules are easily replaceable and extensible, catering to various experimental needs.
- **Extensibility**: Researchers can effortlessly integrate new functionalities and consensus protocols for testing and optimization.

## Current Status

The platform is still under development, with features being actively improved. I welcome collaboration and discussions with anyone interested in blockchain technology!
